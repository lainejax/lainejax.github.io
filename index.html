<h1>My puppy Ziggy</h1>
<p>
My puppy Ziggy is an adorable dog with soft, brown eyes. His nickname is Zig-Zag, and he barks-no, howls- a whole lot. He loves to lick people, and making new friends is his nature. He's bright and bubbly and will not bite. I cannot get any pictures of him, as he's probably no famous. So, I will do my best to describe him.<br></p>
<ol id="cute-list">
<li>Eyes like brown chocolate hazelnut sauce
<li>Black fur with a white ligtning bolt on neck
<li>On head, there is orangish fur and muzzle is white
</ol>
<p id="last-paragraph">My dog is not very well trained yet. He is still meltingly cute. I have described him as best as I can. Okay, now I'm going to talk about
using a bow and arrow (well, at least the model I have- so this should at least give you a good idea how. First step- <strong>load the bow.</strong>
Your arrow should have two loops at the back. sick the bow string in the middle hole. (This is a fiddly process- patience.) Got it loaded? 
Step Two: Pull the string back. Aim. Release. Always keep both eyes open in aiming process. NEVER aim at people, unless your life is in danger.
It is very fun. Okee... well, happy archery and/or thinking about Ziggy, my dog. HOORAY!
